                    Ultimate media often discusses the club and UFA divisions exclusively.
                    Commentators will hint that the DC Breeze or Colorado Summit have high
                    ceilings without referencing Johnny Bravo and Truck Stop winning club nationals.
                    This project links USAU and UFA datasets to examine how UFA players participate in
                    the club division.
